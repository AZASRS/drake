This is the example from [Kirill MÃ¼ller's `drake` pitch slides](https://krlmlr.github.io/drake-pitch), and it is the most accessible example for beginners. For more info, see the [Get Started](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/drake.html) page (or equivalently, the [`drake.Rmd`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/vignettes/drake.Rmd) vignette).
