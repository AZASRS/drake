# Instructions

This file `report.Rmd` belongs to the example from [Kirill Müller's brief introduction to the `drake` R package](https://krlmlr.github.io/drake-pitch/). It does not compile from scratch because it is a [file target](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/file_out.html) in a [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)-powered reproducible workflow ([details here](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/best-practices.html#r-markdown-and-knitr-reports)).

To compile this report,

1. Name it `report.Rmd`.
2. Install the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) packages. 
3. Run the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow in the code chunk below.

Step 3 not only generates the output file `report.html`, but also produces a `.drake/` cache in your working directory, which enables `report.Rmd` to compile on its own with with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), [`knitr`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr), or [`rmarkdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown). A great way way to generate `report.html` is still `make(plan)`. That way, compilation happens if and only if there were changes to `report.Rmd`, `report.html`, `raw_data`, `fit`, or `hist` since the last `make()`.

```{r prework, eval = FALSE}
# Load your packages in the usual way.

library(drake)
library(tidyverse)

# Your custom code is a bunch of functions.

get_data <- function(){
  iris
}

create_plot <- function(data) {
  ggplot(data, aes(x = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) +
    geom_histogram()
}

# The workflow plan is a data frame.
# It outlines the steps of the workflow but does not run it.

plan <- drake_plan(
  raw_data = get_data(),
  data = raw_data %>%
    mutate(Species = forcats::fct_inorder(Species)),
  hist = create_plot(data),
  fit = lm(Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width + Species, data),
  rmarkdown::render(
    knitr_in("skeleton.Rmd"),
    output_file = file_out("report.html"),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
)

# The make() function actually runs the workflow
# and generates report.html.

make(plan)
```
