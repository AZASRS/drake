# Instructions

This file `report.Rmd` belongs to the example from [Kirill Müller's brief introduction to the `drake` R package](https://krlmlr.github.io/drake-pitch/). It does not compile from scratch because it is a [file target](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/file_out.html) in a [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)-powered reproducible workflow ([details here](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/articles/best-practices.html#r-markdown-and-knitr-reports)).

To compile this report,

1. Name it `report.Rmd`.
2. Install the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) packages. 
3. Use [`run_drake.R`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/drake/skeleton/run_drake.R) (included with this template) to run the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow that compiles this report.

Step 3 not only generates the output file `report.html`, but also produces a `.drake/` cache in your working directory, which enables `report.Rmd` to compile on its own with with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), [`knitr`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr), or [`rmarkdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown). A great way way to generate `report.html` is still `make(plan)`. That way, compilation happens if and only if there were changes to `report.Rmd`, `report.html`, `raw_data`, `fit`, or `hist` since the last `make()`.
