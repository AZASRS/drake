\title{Get the cache at the exact file path specified.}
\usage{
this_cache(path = NULL, force = FALSE, verbose = 1L,
  fetch_cache = NULL, console_log_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{file path of the cache}

\item{force}{deprecated
is compatible with your current version of drake.}

\item{verbose}{logical or numeric, control printing to the console.
\itemize{
\item \code{0} or \code{FALSE}: print nothing.
\item \code{1} or \code{TRUE}: print only targets to build.
\item \code{2}: also print checks and cache info.
\item \code{3}: also print any potentially missing items.
\item \code{4}: also print imports and writes to the cache.
}}

\item{fetch_cache}{character vector containing lines of code.
The purpose of this code is to fetch the \code{storr} cache
with a command like \code{\link[=storr_rds]{storr_rds()}} or \code{\link[=storr_dbi]{storr_dbi()}},
but customized. This feature is experimental. It will turn out
to be necessary if you are using both custom non-RDS caches
and distributed parallelism (\code{parallelism = "future_lapply"}
or \code{"Makefile"}) because the distributed R sessions
need to know how to load the cache.}

\item{console_log_file}{character scalar,
connection object (such as \code{stdout()}) or \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, console output will be printed
to the R console using \code{message()}.
If a character scalar, \code{console_log_file}
should be the name of a flat file, and
console output will be appended to that file.
If a connection object (e.g. \code{stdout()})
warnings and messages will be sent to the connection.
For example, if \code{console_log_file} is \code{stdout()},
warnings and messages are printed to the console in real time
(in addition to the usual in-bulk printing
after each target finishes).}
}
\value{
A drake/storr cache at the specified path, if it exists.
}
\description{
This function does not apply to
in-memory caches such as \code{storr_environment()}.
